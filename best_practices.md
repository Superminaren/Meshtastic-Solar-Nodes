# Best Practices for outdoor builds

## Electrical 
- Draw a diagram of your circuit while checking schematics. This way you'll know how things should connect when you cement your design.
- DON'T ever work on a node while plugged into the wall or a battery. At best this could kill your node, at worst you could have a battery fire.
- Double-check polarities before soldering battery-holders or others. This can be costly or even dangerous.

# Weatherproofing
## Case proofing
- Put a silica bag or two in the case if you don't have a pressure vent in a pressure sealed case. Moisture is likely present and you want to control where it gets.
- Put connectors on the downfacing side of the case if possible, this prevents water ingress in heavy rain or snow due to gravity.
- Keep internals suspended away from walls if possible, this avoids direct water contact in case of a leak.
- Get cases from reputable brands or stores. Your "IP67" could show its true nature and destroy your node otherwise. (This doesn't have to be expensive either.)
## Component proofing
- For the electrical you can use some conformal coating (MG Chemicals is recommended), this can be soldered through easily if needed and also acts as a guarding layer for your components. 
- Cement in connectors with outdoor silicone (Marine Rating), this keeps them as dry as possible if you have an exposed node.
